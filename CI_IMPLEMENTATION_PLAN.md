## Notes for Implementation
- Start with minimal synthetic data to validate test infrastructure
- Focus on testing the "lego block" workflow that users actually use
- Ensure PyQt5 dependencies are properly excluded from CI testing
- Maintain compatibility with existing Docker workflows
- Design tests to catch the common failure modes (channel/epoch dropping)
