## Historical Notes for Implementation
- Started with minimal synthetic data to validate test infrastructure
- Focused on testing the "lego block" workflow that users actually use
- Ensured PyQt5 dependencies are properly excluded from CI testing
- Maintained compatibility with existing Docker workflows
- Designed tests to catch the common failure modes (channel/epoch dropping)
- Exceeded original scope with advanced monitoring, security, and automation features
