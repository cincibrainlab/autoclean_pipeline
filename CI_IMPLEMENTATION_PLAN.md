## Implementation Priority Order
1. **Phase 1**: Testing Infrastructure (Foundation)
2. **Phase 2**: Unit Tests (Core Functionality)
3. **Phase 4.1**: Basic CI Workflow (Immediate Value)
4. **Phase 3**: Integration Tests (Comprehensive Coverage)
5. **Phase 4.2-4.3**: Documentation and PR Workflows
6. **Phase 5-6**: Advanced Features and Optimization

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All existing functionality covered by tests
- [ ] CI pipeline runs in <15 minutes for standard checks
- [ ] 100% of PRs pass CI before merge
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully on all changes
- [ ] Real data testing workflow available for validation

## Notes for Implementation
- Start with minimal synthetic data to validate test infrastructure
- Focus on testing the "lego block" workflow that users actually use
- Ensure PyQt5 dependencies are properly excluded from CI testing
- Maintain compatibility with existing Docker workflows
- Design tests to catch the common failure modes (channel/epoch dropping)
