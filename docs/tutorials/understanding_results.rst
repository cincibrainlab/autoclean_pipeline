Understanding Your AutoClean Results
===================================

After AutoClean processes your EEG data, it creates a comprehensive set of outputs. This guide helps you understand what everything means and how to use your results effectively.

üìÅ Overview: What AutoClean Creates
-----------------------------------

When AutoClean finishes processing, you'll find a timestamped folder in your workspace output directory:

.. code-block::

   output/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subject001_rest_2025-06-11_14-30-25/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bids/                 # Processed data (what you need!)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                 # Processing details  
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata/             # Reports and summaries
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stage/                # Intermediate files

**The most important folder is `bids/` - this contains your cleaned, analysis-ready data.**

üß† Understanding Your Processed Data
------------------------------------

**Continuous Clean Data (continuous_clean.fif)**

*What it is:*
- Your original EEG with artifacts removed
- Maintains original time structure
- Ready for time-domain analysis

*Use it for:*
- Connectivity analysis
- Time-frequency analysis
- Event-related potential analysis
- Custom epoching

**Epoched Clean Data (epochs_clean.fif)**

*What it is:*
- Data split into short segments (usually 2-4 seconds)
- Bad epochs already removed
- Ready for spectral analysis

*Use it for:*
- Power spectral density analysis
- Frequency domain connectivity
- Statistical comparisons
- Machine learning features

**ICA Solution (ica_solution.fif)**

*What it is:*
- Mathematical decomposition of your data
- Separates brain activity from artifacts
- Shows what was removed and why

*Use it for:*
- Verifying artifact removal was appropriate
- Understanding data cleaning decisions
- Advanced troubleshooting

üìà Data Quality Metrics Explained
---------------------------------

**Channel Quality Metrics**

*Channels Interpolated:*
- Bad channels that were reconstructed
- Normal: 0-5% of channels
- Concerning: >10% of channels

*Channel Noise Levels:*
- Average noise after cleaning
- Lower values = cleaner data
- Typical range: 10-50 ŒºV

**Temporal Quality Metrics**

*Epochs Rejected:*
- Percentage of data removed as artifacts
- Normal: 10-30% rejection
- Concerning: >50% rejection

*Artifact Types Detected:*
- Eye movements: Usually 1-3 components
- Muscle artifacts: Usually 1-2 components  
- Heart artifacts: Usually 0-1 components

**Spectral Quality Metrics**

*Frequency Band Power:*
- Delta (0.5-4 Hz): Slow wave activity
- Theta (4-8 Hz): Attention/memory
- Alpha (8-13 Hz): Relaxed awareness
- Beta (13-30 Hz): Active thinking
- Gamma (30+ Hz): High-level processing

*Line Noise Reduction:*
- 50/60 Hz artifact removal
- Should show significant reduction
- Residual noise <5% of original

üîç Advanced Analysis: What to Look For
-------------------------------------

**Successful Artifact Removal Signs:**

*ICA Components Removed:*
- Clear eye movement patterns in frontal components
- Muscle artifacts with high-frequency, localized patterns
- Heart artifacts with regular, rhythmic patterns

*Clean Data Characteristics:*
- Smooth, brain-like oscillations
- Reasonable amplitude ranges (10-100 ŒºV)
- No obvious periodic artifacts
- Consistent noise levels across channels

**Potential Issues to Watch For:**

*Over-cleaning:*
- Too many ICA components removed (>15)
- Unrealistically low noise levels
- Loss of natural brain oscillations

*Under-cleaning:*
- Obvious eye blinks still visible
- Muscle artifacts in temporal regions
- 50/60 Hz line noise still present

üõ†Ô∏è Using Your Results in Analysis Software
-------------------------------------------

**Loading Data in Python (MNE):**

.. code-block:: python

   import mne
   
   # Load continuous data
   raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif('bids/derivatives/continuous_clean.fif')
   
   # Load epoched data  
   epochs = mne.read_epochs('bids/derivatives/epochs_clean.fif')
   
   # Your analysis here
   psd = epochs.compute_psd()

**Loading Data in MATLAB (EEGLAB):**

.. code-block:: matlab

   % AutoClean can export .set files for EEGLAB
   EEG = pop_loadset('epochs_clean.set', 'bids/derivatives/');
   
   % Continue with EEGLAB analysis
   [spectra, freqs] = spectopo(EEG.data, 0, EEG.srate);

**Loading Data in R:**

.. code-block:: r

   library(eegUtils)
   
   # Load processed data
   eeg_data <- import_set("bids/derivatives/epochs_clean.set")
   
   # Continue analysis
   psd <- compute_psd(eeg_data)

üìã Quality Control Checklist
----------------------------

Before using your data for analysis, check:

**‚úÖ Data Integrity**
- [ ] Processing completed without errors
- [ ] Output files were created successfully  
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable (not empty or huge)

**‚úÖ Quality Metrics**
- [ ] >70% of epochs retained
- [ ] >85% of channels retained
- [ ] Appropriate number of ICA components removed

**‚úÖ Visual Inspection**
- [ ] Clean data looks like brain activity
- [ ] No obvious artifacts remain
- [ ] Reasonable amplitude ranges

**‚úÖ Processing Log Review**
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] All processing steps completed
- [ ] Parameter settings were appropriate

üÜò When Results Look Wrong
-------------------------

**High Data Loss (>50% epochs rejected):**
- Check original data quality
- Verify appropriate task was used
- Consider adjusting artifact detection sensitivity

**Poor Artifact Removal:**
- Review ICA component classifications
- Check if additional preprocessing needed
- Verify electrode positions were correct

**Unexpected Processing Errors:**
- Check log files in logs/ folder
- Verify input data format is supported
- Ensure sufficient disk space available

**File Format Issues:**
- AutoClean outputs standard formats (.fif, .set)
- Use conversion tools if needed for your analysis software
- Contact support for format-specific questions

üìä Documenting Your Processing
-----------------------------

**For Research Papers:**
Keep records of:
- AutoClean version used
- Task name and parameters
- Data quality metrics
- Any custom processing steps

**Example Methods Text:**
"EEG data were preprocessed using AutoClean v1.4.1 with the RestingEyesOpen task. Data were filtered (1-100 Hz), bad channels interpolated (mean: 2.3%), and artifacts removed using ICA. On average, 78% of epochs were retained after artifact rejection."

üéâ Next Steps
-------------

Now that you understand your results:

1. **Start Analysis:** Use your clean data for research questions
2. **Quality Control:** Develop systematic QC procedures
