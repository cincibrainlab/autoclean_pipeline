# Analysis Tools

The AutoClean Pipeline provides various analysis tools for processing and visualizing EEG data. This section covers the different analysis modules available in the pipeline.

## Available Analysis Modules

### ASSR Analysis

The [ASSR Analysis](assr-analysis.md) module provides tools for analyzing Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR) data, including:

- Time-frequency analysis
- Inter-Trial Coherence (ITC) visualization
- Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) visualization
- Single Trial Power (STP) visualization
- Heat map export for group-level analysis
- Group-level analysis across multiple subjects

This module is particularly useful for analyzing 40 Hz ASSR paradigms, which are commonly used to study neural synchronization in various populations.

## Visualization Guide

The [ASSR Analysis](assr-analysis.md) documentation includes a comprehensive visualization guide that covers:

- How to use each visualization function
- Examples with code snippets
- Customizing visualizations
- Exporting data for group analysis
- Group-level visualizations and comparisons

The guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating various types of visualizations, from basic time-frequency plots to advanced group-level topographic maps.

## Future Analysis Modules

We plan to add more analysis modules in the future, including:

- Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis
- Time-frequency analysis for other paradigms
- Connectivity analysis
- Source localization
- Machine learning integration

If you have suggestions for additional analysis modules, please submit an issue or pull request on the project's GitHub repository.
