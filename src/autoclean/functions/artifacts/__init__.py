"""Artifact Detection and Removal Functions.

This module contains standalone functions for detecting and removing various
types of artifacts from EEG data, including bad channels, ICA-based artifact
removal, and noise detection.

Functions
---------
detect_bad_channels : Identify bad channels using various criteria
interpolate_bad_channels : Interpolate bad channels
fit_ica : Perform ICA decomposition
classify_ica_components : Classify ICA components as artifacts or brain activity
apply_ica_rejection : Remove artifact components from data
detect_muscle_artifacts : Identify muscle artifacts
annotate_noisy_segments : Mark noisy time segments
