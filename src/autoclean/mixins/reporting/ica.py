"""ICA reporting mixin for autoclean tasks.

This module provides specialized ICA visualization and reporting functionality for
the AutoClean pipeline. It defines methods for generating comprehensive visualizations
and reports of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) results, including:

- Full-duration component activations
- Component properties and classifications
- Rejected components with their properties
- Interactive and static reports

These reports help users understand the ICA decomposition and validate component rejection
decisions to ensure appropriate artifact removal.

Example:
    ```python
    from autoclean.core.task import Task
    from mne.preprocessing import ICA
    
    class MyICATask(Task):
        def process(self, raw, pipeline, autoclean_dict):
            # Perform ICA decomposition
            ica = ICA(n_components=20)
            ica.fit(raw)
            
            # Create visualizations and reports
            self.plot_ica_components(ica, raw, autoclean_dict, pipeline)
            self.generate_ica_report(ica, raw, autoclean_dict, pipeline)
    ```

    """Mixin providing ICA reporting functionality for EEG data.
    
    This mixin extends the base ReportingMixin with specialized methods for
    generating visualizations and reports of ICA results. It provides tools for
    assessing component properties, visualizing component activations, and
    documenting component rejection decisions.
    
    All reporting methods respect configuration toggles from `autoclean_config.yaml`,
    checking if their corresponding step is enabled before execution. Each method
    can be individually enabled or disabled via configuration.
    
    Available ICA reporting methods include:
    
    - `plot_ica_full`: Plot all ICA components over the full recording duration
    - `plot_ica_components`: Generate plots of ICA components with properties
    - `plot_ica_sources`: Plot ICA sources with EOG channel overlay
    - `generate_ica_report`: Create a comprehensive report of ICA decomposition results

        This method creates a figure showing each ICA component's time course over the full
        recording duration. Components are color-coded by their classification/rejection status,
        and probability scores are indicated for each component.
        
        Args:
            pipeline: Pipeline object containing raw data and fitted ICA object.
            autoclean_dict: Dictionary containing metadata about the processing run.
            
        Returns:
            matplotlib.figure.Figure: The generated figure with ICA components.
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If no ICA object is found in the pipeline.
            
        Example:
            ```python
            # After performing ICA
            fig = task.plot_ica_full(pipeline, autoclean_dict)
            plt.show()
            ```
            
        Notes:
            - Components classified as artifacts are highlighted in red
            - Classification probabilities are shown for each component
            - The method respects configuration settings via the `ica_full_plot_step` config
