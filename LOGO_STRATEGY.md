## Step-by-Step Logo Creation Process

### Step 1: Concept Development with ChatGPT

#### Initial Prompt for Main Logo:
```
I'm creating a logo for AutoClean EEG, a scientific software platform that automates EEG (brain wave) data cleaning and processing. It uses AI to remove artifacts and noise from brain signals. The software is professional, used by neuroscience researchers, and emphasizes automation, precision, and clean data. Could you suggest logo concepts that capture these values?
```

#### Refining Concepts:
```
The logo should incorporate:
- Brain or neural elements (subtle, not medical)
- Wave or signal processing imagery
- Clean, modern, tech aesthetic
- Professional appearance suitable for scientific publications
- Scalable design that works as an icon
```

### Step 2: Creating AI Generator Prompts

#### Main AutoClean Logo Prompt:
```
Create a minimalist logo for "AutoClean EEG" - a scientific software for automated brain signal processing. Design features:
- Abstract brain outline merged with clean sine wave
- Modern tech aesthetic with gradient from deep blue to cyan
- Clean, professional style suitable for research software
- Incorporate subtle cleaning/purification element (sparkle or wave)
- Simple enough to work as 16x16 favicon
- No text, icon only
```

#### AutoClean Pipeline Logo Prompt:
```
Create a logo variation for "AutoClean Pipeline" module:
- Connected nodes showing data flow left to right
- Brain signal entering, clean signal exiting
- Use same blue-cyan color scheme as main logo
- Incorporate pipeline/flow visualization
- Maintain minimalist, scientific aesthetic
```

#### AutoClean Vision Logo Prompt:
```
Create a logo for "AutoClean Vision" - AI component labeling module:
- Stylized eye combined with neural network nodes
- Eye "seeing" EEG components
- Integrate brain/neural imagery
- Same color family but add purple accent for AI
- Modern, tech-forward appearance
```

#### AutoClean Review Logo Prompt:
```
Create a logo for "AutoClean Review" - results inspection GUI:
- Magnifying glass examining clean waveform
- Checkmark or quality indicator
- Interactive/dynamic feel
- Green accent color for "approved/reviewed"
- Consistent with logo family style
```

### Step 3: Color Palette Strategy

#### Primary Colors:
- **Deep Blue** (#1E3A8A): Trust, stability, science
- **Cyan** (#06B6D4): Technology, clarity, cleanliness
- **White** (#FFFFFF): Purity, simplicity

#### Module-Specific Accents:
- **Pipeline**: Orange (#F59E0B) - Flow, processing
- **Vision**: Purple (#8B5CF6) - AI, intelligence
- **Review**: Green (#10B981) - Approval, validation
- **Studio**: Gray (#6B7280) - Professional, integrated

### Step 4: Typography Guidelines

#### Font Selection Prompt:
```
Suggest modern, clean fonts for scientific software that pairs well with our minimalist brain/wave logo. Need:
- Excellent readability at small sizes
- Professional appearance
- Tech-forward but not trendy
- Works in both UI and documentation
```

Recommended options:
- Primary: Inter, Roboto, or Source Sans Pro
- Monospace (code): JetBrains Mono, Fira Code

### Step 5: Logo Variations

#### Size Variations:
1. **Full Logo**: Icon + "AutoClean" text
2. **Compact**: Icon + "AC" 
3. **Icon Only**: For favicons, app icons
4. **Wordmark**: Text only for documents

#### Context Variations:
- Light backgrounds
- Dark backgrounds  
- Monochrome (for printing)
- High contrast (accessibility)

### Step 6: Implementation Guidelines

#### File Formats to Request:
- **SVG**: Primary format for all uses
- **PNG**: 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 512x512
- **ICO**: Windows application icon
- **ICNS**: macOS application icon

#### Usage Examples:
```
CLI Header: ASCII art version of logo
GUI Window: Full logo in title bar
Documentation: Wordmark in header
GitHub: Icon as repository image
PyPI: Icon for package listing
```

### Step 7: ASCII Art Versions

For CLI usage, create ASCII representations:

```
Main AutoClean:
    ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
    ‚îÇ ‚àø‚àø‚àø ‚îÇ  AutoClean
    ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ
