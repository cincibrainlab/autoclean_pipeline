# AutoClean Pipeline Project Status Report

## Recent Progress

We have significantly enhanced the AutoClean pipeline's documentation and examples. We have created comprehensive documentation covering key aspects of the pipeline including configuration files, troubleshooting, API references, and developer guides. Additionally, we implemented a series of practical examples demonstrating various use cases and capabilities of the pipeline. The documentation structure now provides both user-oriented guides and technical API references, making the system more accessible to researchers with varying levels of programming experience.

The primary focus was on creating practical examples showing how to use the pipeline for different EEG processing tasks. We developed examples for basic usage, custom step functions, custom tasks, batch processing, and advanced configuration options. These examples include detailed code with extensive comments, making it easy for researchers to adapt them to their own needs. Each example is self-contained and can generate simulated data when real EEG files are not available, ensuring that users can test the functionality immediately without requiring external datasets.

The project now has a much more comprehensive documentation foundation covering configuration guides, troubleshooting information, API references for core components (Pipeline, Task, and step functions), and developer guides for extending the system. The troubleshooting documentation has been expanded to cover common issues across different operating systems, and the API references now detail all key methods, properties, and parameters. The examples directory includes practical code samples that can serve as templates for various EEG processing needs, complete with a README explaining how to use each example.

## Current Challenges

While the documentation and examples have been significantly improved, there are still areas requiring attention. The troubleshooting guide would benefit from more specific error messages and solutions based on real-world user feedback. Some of the advanced features like custom step function development might require more detailed explanations and real-world use cases. Additionally, while the documentation explains how to use the pipeline with different EEG paradigms, more examples specific to various experimental designs would be helpful.

The examples, while comprehensive, still use simulated data for demonstration purposes. Integration with publicly available EEG datasets would make the examples more realistic and demonstrate how the pipeline performs on actual experimental data. The configuration system has extensive options that could be better documented with more specific recommendations for different research scenarios. Currently, users might need to experiment with different settings to find optimal parameters for their specific EEG paradigms.

In the API documentation, some of the more advanced or less commonly used methods might require additional examples and explanations. The documentation for extending the system with new tasks and step functions could benefit from more advanced examples involving complex processing pipelines. Additionally, performance optimization guidelines for processing large datasets or implementing computationally intensive processing steps could be further developed.

## Next Steps

The immediate priority is to integrate the documentation with a proper documentation site generator (such as Sphinx or MkDocs) to provide better navigation and search functionality. We should also implement a continuous integration process to automatically rebuild and update the documentation when changes are made to the codebase. Additionally, gathering feedback from early users on the clarity and usefulness of the documentation should guide further improvements.

Further development should focus on creating more paradigm-specific examples and tasks for common EEG experiments like MMN, P300, ASSR, and sleep studies. We should also develop more comprehensive examples for batch processing in high-performance computing environments and cloud infrastructure. The step functions library could be expanded to include more advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning integration for automated artifact detection and classification.

Longer-term goals include developing better visualization tools for EEG data exploration and results presentation, improving the pipeline's performance for large-scale studies, and adding more sophisticated statistical analysis capabilities. We should also consider developing a web-based interface for configuring and monitoring pipeline processing, which would make the system more accessible to researchers with limited programming experience. Finally, compiling a comprehensive benchmark of the pipeline's performance across different hardware configurations and dataset sizes would help users optimize their processing workflows.
